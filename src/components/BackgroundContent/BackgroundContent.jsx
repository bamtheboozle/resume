          I began my web development career at Questia Group, a young and fast
          growing company focusing on real time surveys and analytics. Here,
          I've developed responsive, secure websites using AngularJS and
          BackboneJS on the front-end, and PHP Symfony2 and Java Hibernate on
          the back-end.

        <p>
          I also built a hybrid iOS/Android app using Ionic and Cordova that
          allowed users to easily access the platforms from their phones, as the
          main website was not optimized for mobile.
